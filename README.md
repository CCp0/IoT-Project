# IoT-Project
IoT project for semester 2

This project uses augmented reality to monitor and display social distance upkeep and temperature. This info will be uploaded to a spreadsheet via API to check statistics about maintaining covid guidelines. 
The code present works each sensor and the display individually as of the 25/03/2021. This will be merged together to form the main AR code over the Easter holidays before the final project.
